We are testing the system through which the assignments for the exams are delivered to the students.
In fact, different students can be assigned different exercises.
We build a compressed file containing all the exercises for one student (or group of students) and make it available at a private secret URL which we deliver to the student by mail.
We have developed a system for preparing the exercises, collecting them into a compressed file, and uploading them for the exams.
This file is part of a dummy assignment meant only to test the system.

This file is:
   contained in the subdirectory subfolder_test of the directory template_testo_esame_dummy

If you got these files and directories then the shuttle is already beyond the hidden face of the moon.
That's one small step for 'a' man, one giant leap for mankind.
